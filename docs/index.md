# ParamTatva Research Center

CERN-grade particle & field simulation/reconstruction, built on the **ParamTatva fundamental string** concept:
two engines (native fast + Geant4/ACTS interop), always-green physics tests, deterministic runs, and
Sanskrit-forward configuration.

!!! tip "TL;DR"
    - `pip install -e pt-sim`  
    - `pytest -q` to verify the core physics unit tests  
    - `mkdocs serve` for these docs

See **Getting Started â†’ Quickstart** to run the Week-1 demo.
