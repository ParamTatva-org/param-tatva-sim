# Our CERN-grade North-star outcomes (what “CERN-grade” means)

* **Physics fidelity**: full Geant4-level tracking & calorimetry, realistic material maps, magnetic field maps, pileup, digitization, triggers.
* **Throughput**: simulate/reconstruct **10^8–10^9** events/year with mixed workloads (full sim + ML-fastsim), reproducibly.
* **Validation**: unit/physics tests that lock against beam/test-beam data or published references; CI that fails on physics regressions, not just code breaks.
* **Interoperability**: painless exchange with HEP standards: ROOT I/O, HepMC3, LCIO, Acts geometry, Gaudi-like job options.

# Architecture (clean layers & tech choices)

1. **Frontdoor APIs (Python-first, typed)**

   * Python package `paramtatva` exposes: `eventgen`, `detector`, `sim`, `reco`, `daq`, `analysis`.
   * Strict pydantic dataclasses for configs (detector, beam, physics lists, seeds).

2. **Core engines (Rust/C++ fast path)**

   * Keep **pt-core (Rust)** for math/inner loops; expand to:

     * Boris pusher (relativistic), symplectic integrators, adaptive stepping.
     * Field solvers (FDTD/Yee for EM, multigrid Poisson for electrostatics).
     * Geometry & navigation (BVH/KD-tree) with exact boundary stepping.
   * Add **C++ bridge** for Geant4/Acts interop when needed. Expose via PyO3 & pybind11 shims.

3. **Physics modules**

   * **Event generators**: plug adapters for Pythia8 / Herwig / MadGraph (read HepMC3).
   * **Transport**: native engine for toy/fast, **and** optional **Geant4 backend** for full sim (select per run: `engine="native"|"geant4"`).
   * **Detector response**: modular digitizers (ECAL/HCAL/Tracker/Muon), electronics shaping, time-of-flight, noise, miscalibration, dead/hot channels.
   * **Reconstruction**:

     * Tracking via **ACTS** (seed, CKF, GNN-seeding optional).
     * Calo clustering (TopoCluster-style + ML surrogates).
     * Particle-flow prototype.

4. **Data & workflow**

   * Native I/O: **ROOT** trees for events (+ Parquet mirrors for analytics).
   * **HepMC3** for generator inputs/outputs.
   * Job control: yaml “job options” → DAG in **Gaudi-like** scheduler (lightweight).
   * Scale-out: local (Ray) → cluster (**SLURM/K8s**) with artifacted environments (Nix or micromamba lockfiles).

5. **ML acceleration**

   * **Fast-sim surrogates**: Calorimeter showers (CaloGAN-style), parametric tracker material effects, pileup mixing nets.
   * **Graph ML for tracking** (HEP-Trkx-style), **set transformers** for PF.
   * **Differentiable physics hooks** (JAX/PyTorch) for fine-tuning params to data.

# Physics fidelity backlog (priority order)

1. **Relativistic transport**

   * Implement Boris pusher + adaptive step with curvature/radius guard.
   * Add exact helical step in uniform B for reference solutions.
2. **Materials & geometry**

   * Detector description: GDML import; per-volume X0, λI, density, B-field maps.
   * Multiple scattering (Highland), dE/dx (Bethe-Bloch) with composition mixing.
3. **Showers**

   * EM: gamma-function longitudinal + Molière lateral → cross-validated to Geant4 EM standard.
   * Hadronic: two-component model (π±/n, EM fraction fluctuations) before full Geant4 handoff.
4. **Digitization realism**

   * Shaping, time slicing, thresholds, saturation, electronics noise, pileup mixing, out-of-time pileup.
5. **Alignment, calibration, conditions**

   * **Conditions DB** (sqlite/postgres) with IOV tags for B-field, gains, pedestals, alignment.
6. **Trigger/DAQ toy**

   * L1 emulation (simple sums/roads), HLT with ML filters; throughput metrics.

# Validation & testing (what “done” looks like)

* **Golden physics tests** (pytest marks):

  * Uniform-B helix residuals < 1e-6 relative.
  * EM shower energy closure: |Σcell−E|/E < 0.5% (no noise).
  * Longitudinal/lateral moments within reference bands vs Geant4 for a grid of E, η.
  * Tracking: efficiency vs pT/η curves within expected tolerances on a toy barrel.
* **Reproducibility**: global seed protocol; deterministic kernels where feasible.
* **Performance gates**: criterion benchmarks (Rust) + asv (Python) tracked in CI; regressions >5% fail.

---

# Scale & infra

* **Execution backends**: CPU (TBB/rayon), **CUDA** (cupy/torch), **SYCL** (oneAPI) long-term.
* **Job orchestration**: Ray for embarrassingly parallel MC; dask for IO-heavy; SLURM profiles for HPC.
* **Data volumes**: shard ROOT files \~2–4 GB each; metadata catalog; automatic parquet sidecars for analysis.
* **Observability**: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for throughput, memory, IO; MLflow/W\&B for model runs.

---

# Interop waypoints (so we can “speak CERN”)

* **HepMC3 in/out** for generator truth.
* **ROOT**: RNTuple or TTree writers/readers with schema versioning.
* **Geant4 plugin**: compile-time optional; run-time selectable.
* **ACTS**: geometry transform from GDML → Acts surfaces; seeds → fits roundtrip.
* **Gaudi-like job options**: yaml → pipeline graph; easy to share/peer review.

---

# 6-week execution sprint (concrete, bite-sized)

**Week 1–2**

* Add **Boris pusher + adaptive step** in `pt-core`, helix analytic tests.
* Introduce **Conditions DB** (sqlite) and wire gains/pedestals/field maps.
* Standardize **ROOT/HepMC3 I/O** (write + minimal read).

**Week 3–4**

* Geometry & materials: GDML import → per-volume material/X0/λI; path-length with boundary stepping.
* EM shower module v1 with **moment tests** vs Geant4 references (small grid, 10 energies).

**Week 5**

* Digitization v2: shaping, thresholds, realistic noise, pileup mixing; energy-closure unit tests.
* Ray job runner for param scans; CI benchmarks (criterion + asv) with thresholds.

**Week 6**

* ACTS minimal tracking chain on a toy barrel (truth seeding → CKF) + efficiency plots.
* Draft **Physics Validation Report v0** (figures auto-generated from tests).

# Immediate code tasks (surgical PRs)

* Core: add `boris_step_relativistic(q, m, B(r), E(r), v, dt)` + tests; curvature-based dt limiter.
* Fields: Yee grid for EM; Poisson solver (multigrid) for static φ; file-backed field maps.
* Showers: refactor EM to accept `(E, η, X0, Ec)`; detach lateral kernel; add Molière radius computation.
* I/O: `Event` dataclass → `to_hepmc3()` / `from_hepmc3()`, `to_root(tree)`; schema version tag.
* Conditions: `conditions.get(tag, time, key)`; cache + IOVs.
* Bench: criterion suites for stepper, shower fill, digitizer; asv for end-to-end throughput.

---

# People/process (to keep us sane)

* **Coding standard**: mypy+ruff; docs with mkdocs; every physics PR must update tests/plots.
* **Design reviews**: short ADRs for module contracts & format decisions.
* **Data governance**: hash-stamped configs; run registry with seeds, git SHA, container digest.

---

# Where this ties back to ParamTatva

* **Research**: “Fundamental String” center can host the field/EM solvers + string compactification toy models (your Rust core is perfect for fast KK/winding scans).
* **Stack**: AI/Data stacks power fast-sim surrogates (Calo/Tracking), Sanskrit-encoded configuration vocabulary (Maheshwara-sutra-mapped parameter schema).
* **Fund/Centre**: A reproducible, transparent pipeline becomes a training ground for schools/startups and a credible research hub.
